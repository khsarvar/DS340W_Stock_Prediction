Stock price prediction using machine learning models has been an active area of research for several years. While accurate prediction of stock trends is important, the ultimate goal is to determine whether these predictions can be effectively used in actual stock trading to generate profits. In this study, we investigate the applicability of machine learning models in stock trading by examining their performance in predicting future stock trends and applying these predictions in real-world trading scenarios. To accomplish this, we trained two machine learning models, Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) and Random Forest (RF), using technical indicators to predict the estimated stock trend of the next day (whether it will increase or decrease). Also we compared the features that is the best for the model to be used from the technical features. We then applied these models in actual stock trading and created a buy signal feature based on the predicted trends. Our results show that (insert model name) generated a profit of (insert dollar amount) with (insert percentage) more test accuracy compared to the other model. Features like, () were the most helpful for our model. These findings demonstrate the potential applicability of machine learning models in stock trading and suggest that further research in this area could lead to improved profitability for traders.
